I will implement a mobile adaptation plan focusing on font size optimization.

## Analysis
- **Current State**: The `style.css` file already contains some mobile optimizations (added in the previous turn), but the user is requesting a more comprehensive and systematic reduction (10-15%) across all elements (body, headings, buttons, etc.).
- **Goal**: systematically reduce font sizes for screens < 768px while maintaining readability (min 12px) and hierarchy.

## Plan

### 1. Refine Mobile Media Query in `style.css`
I will update the existing `@media (max-width: 768px)` block in [style.css](file:///c%3A/Users/ASUS/Documents/trae_projects/NewYearGame_StepHigher/css/style.css) to implementing a systematic scaling strategy.

- **Root Font Size**: Set `html { font-size: 14px; }` (approx 87.5% of standard 16px) inside the media query. This will automatically scale all `rem`-based sizes down by ~12.5%.
- **Specific Element Tweaks**:
    - **Body Text**: Ensure `p`, `.scroll-text` are at least `1rem` (now 14px) or explicitly set to `1.1rem` (~15.4px) for readability.
    - **Headings**:
        - `h1`: Scale down from desktop `5rem` to `2.5rem` (mobile).
        - `h2`: Scale down from desktop `2.5rem` to `1.5rem` (mobile).
    - **Buttons**: Adjust padding and font size for touch targets.
    - **HUD/Score**: Reduce `.score-display` from `4rem` to `2.5rem`.

### 2. Verify Minimum Font Sizes
- I will ensure no font rule results in a computed size smaller than 12px.
- I will add a comment block documenting the scaling logic.

### 3. Commit and Push
- I will commit the changes with a clear message: `style: systematic mobile font optimization (10-15% reduction)`.
- I will push the changes to GitHub.

*Note: Since I cannot provide screenshots directly, I will provide a detailed text-based "Adapter Guide" in the final response explaining the changes.*
